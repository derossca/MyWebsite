        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p id="aboutme">
            Hello! My name is Corey DeRossett. I am an aspiring web developer. I am currently attending the University 
            of Cincinnati for web development. I began this journey ever since I became interested in the puzzle solving 
            that is coding. I grew up in a small town just outside of Cincinnati called Batavia. After high school, I 
            attained a degree in criminal justice from the University of Cincinnati. After working odd jobs for a few 
            years, I went back to school for a religious studies degree from Cincinnati Christian University. I worked 
            in ministry for a few years in a couple of different places. I started in my hometown, Batavia, went to 
            Anderson, then to Lebanon. I've always stayed close to Cincinnati though.

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>I like a little bit of everything. I am an avid sports fan. I love my hometown Cincinnati 
                    Reds and Bengals. I have season tickets to the University of Cincinnati basketball, but keep 
                    a soft spot in my heart for the University of Kentucky basketball for my grandpa. I like 
                    heavy metal music, Avenged Sevenfold being the best band of all time! Some other things I 
                    like are hiking, swimming, going to the gym, and even going to see plays, musicals, and 
                    orchestras. Best of all, I like to spend time with my family!</p>

                <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
                <p>I am a new father, and it is an exciting journey. I have two poodles. One is really hyper 
                    and my wrestling buddy. The other is my sweet and shy cuddle friend.I have been married for 
                    4 years. I have won national merit honors for academics in high school and never missed the 
                    dean's list in college. I like Cincinnati food, Skyline, LaRosa's Pizza, and Grippos chips. 
                    Overall, I'm just a laid back person who likes to have a good time.</p>
